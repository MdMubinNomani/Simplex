# Simplex Language

A simple programming language created with a custom compiler written in C++. This project was developed to gain a deeper understanding of how compilers function and the principles behind language design.

## How to run simplex
### Step 1
Locate the text file named 'simplex_code.txt' and write Simplex code here. It is crucial to keep the file name as it is.
### Step 2
Locate the executable named 'SimplexCompilerScript.exe' and run it. If the executable is missing, open the cpp file named 'SimplexCompilerScripts.cpp' and run the C++ code in your prefered code editor atleast once. Needless to say, You will need the GNU preinstalled.
